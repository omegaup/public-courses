==========================================

hello this is a sample course to deliver a proof of concept for this year's Gsoc 2025 project Public Courses on github.

I have created a repository which links this course here-
https://github.com/iqbalcodes6602/omi_public_course

You can submit a PR to this repository to update the changes. Once the pr is merged the changes would reflect in the course..



As you can see the version of the problem got updated. This was automatically deployed to the course when the pr was merged.

Please try to change anything in this problem in the Intro folder and submit a PR to the repository.


I have also added one problem content to this course by the name 'Practice' which has a problem 'Contest-Start' in it. You can try to change the content of this problem and submit a PR to the repository as well. I have myself tried to adding some test cases to this problem, and it was working fine on that.
